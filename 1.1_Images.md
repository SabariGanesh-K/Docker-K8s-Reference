Docker images are read-only templates or blueprints used to create Docker containers. An image contains everything needed to run an application, including the application's code, runtime environment, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files.

Here are some key aspects and use cases of Docker images:

Application Packaging: Docker images provide a standardized format for packaging applications and their dependencies. They encapsulate the application stack into a single, self-contained unit, making it easier to distribute and deploy applications across different environments.

Version Control and Reproducibility: Docker images can be versioned and stored in a registry, allowing for easy tracking of changes and ensuring reproducibility. Developers can define the exact dependencies and configurations needed for an application in a Docker image, ensuring consistent behavior across different deployments.

Collaboration and Sharing: Docker images can be shared and reused by different teams and individuals. Developers can create base images that contain common components, such as databases or web servers, and share them with others, saving time and effort in setting up the development environment.

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Docker images play a crucial role in CI/CD pipelines. Developers can build, test, and package applications into Docker images as part of the build process. These images can then be deployed to various environments, ensuring consistency between development, testing, and production stages.

Scalability and Elasticity: Docker images enable easy scaling of applications. Multiple containers can be created from the same image, allowing for horizontal scaling by running multiple instances of the application across different hosts or in a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes.

Rollback and Recovery: Docker images can be used for rollback and recovery scenarios. By keeping track of different versions of the image, you can easily revert to a previous version in case of issues or errors, ensuring the application's stability and availability.

Now, let's discuss the difference between Docker images and containers:

Images are the static, read-only templates that include all the necessary files and dependencies for an application. They are created from a Dockerfile, which specifies the steps to build the image.
Containers, on the other hand, are the running instances of Docker images. Containers are created from images and provide an isolated and portable runtime environment for applications. They can be started, stopped, and deleted, and they run on the host system's Docker engine.
In summary, Docker images are the building blocks or blueprints used to create containers. Images are static and define what an application should look like, while containers are the actual running instances of those images, providing an isolated environment for applications to run.

## COMMANDS


Create a simple HTML file and do the following below:-

## Add a Dockerfile file

Add a new file and name it **Dockerfile** (without any file extension).

Copy and paste the following in the file and save it:

    FROM nginx:alpine
    COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html

## Build the image

    docker build -t <file name>:v1 .

## list the images

    docker images

## Let's create an instance of the image

    docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name hello <file name>:v1

## List the containers running

    docker ps

## Display the page using curl

    curl localhost:8080

or use your browser. Navigate to https://localhost:8080

## Stop the container

Refresh the browser to confirm that it has stopped

    docker stop hello

## List the containers running

You should not see the hello-world:v1 instance anymore.

    docker ps

## Remove the instance from memory

    docker rm hello

## Confirm that the container is no longer running

    docker ps

## Is the image still present?

    docker images

## Delete the image

    docker rmi hello-world:v1
