In Kubernetes, an init container is a specialized type of container that runs and completes before the main containers within a pod start. Init containers are designed to perform initialization tasks or set up specific conditions required for the successful startup of the main containers.

The necessity and use cases of init containers are as follows:

Sequential Initialization: Init containers allow you to define a sequence of tasks that need to be completed before the main containers start. This ensures that dependencies or prerequisites are met before the main application or service begins running. For example, an init container can perform tasks like downloading configuration files, setting up databases, or waiting for external services to become available.

Data Preprocessing or Preloading: Init containers can be used to perform data preprocessing or preloading tasks. They can retrieve or generate data required by the main containers and store it in shared volumes or other resources. This allows the main containers to start with the required data already available, improving the application's startup time and reducing the load on external data sources.

Dependency Management: Init containers are helpful for managing dependencies between containers within a pod. For example, an application may require a separate container to fetch or generate SSL certificates, which are then shared with the main application container. Init containers ensure that the dependent resources are available and properly configured before the main container starts.

Security Setup: Init containers can be used to set up security-related configurations or perform security checks before the main containers start. For instance, an init container can fetch and install security patches or perform security scans on the container image or underlying infrastructure.

One-Time Initialization Tasks: Init containers are suitable for running one-time initialization tasks that are not part of the regular operation of the application. For example, an init container can perform database schema migrations or run scripts to populate initial data. Once the initialization tasks are completed, the init container terminates, and the main containers start.

Parallel Initialization: Init containers can be run in parallel, allowing multiple initialization tasks to be performed simultaneously. This can help reduce the overall initialization time and ensure that the main containers start as quickly as possible.

Debugging and Troubleshooting: Init containers can be used for debugging or troubleshooting purposes. They can be added to a pod to perform diagnostic tasks or collect logs or metrics before the main containers start running. This can aid in identifying issues or gathering information about the environment before the main application starts executing.

In summary, init containers are necessary for performing initialization tasks, managing dependencies, and preparing the environment for the successful startup of main containers within a pod. They help ensure that prerequisites are met, data is preprocessed, and necessary configurations are in place before the main application or service starts running. Init containers provide flexibility and control over the initialization process in Kubernetes pods.


# Let's use an Init container.

## Create the deployment

    kubectl apply -f myapp.yaml

Wait for the main pod to come up

    kubectl get pods

## Connect to the Nginx container

    kubectl exec -it init-demo -- /bin/bash

## Hit the default webpage

It should be the one downloaded by the Init container from http://info.cern.ch

    curl localhost
    exit

## Cleanup

    kubectl delete -f myapp.yaml
