Docker volumes are a feature in Docker that allow for persistent storage and data sharing between containers and the host system. Volumes are directories or file systems that exist outside of the container's file system but can be accessed and used by containers.

The real necessity of Docker volumes can be understood from the following aspects:

Data Persistence: Containers are designed to be ephemeral, meaning they can be created, destroyed, and replaced easily. However, this poses a challenge when it comes to persisting data generated or used by containers. Docker volumes provide a way to store and persist data even if the containers are removed or replaced, ensuring data durability and availability.

Data Sharing: Docker volumes enable data sharing between containers and the host system. Multiple containers can mount the same volume, allowing them to access and share data, facilitating collaboration and communication between different components of an application.

Database and File Storage: Applications often require persistent storage for databases, file systems, or other types of data. Docker volumes provide a reliable and scalable way to store and manage data that needs to survive container restarts or updates.

Backup and Disaster Recovery: Docker volumes make it easier to back up data and implement disaster recovery strategies. By storing data in volumes separate from the containers, you can create backups of the volume contents and restore them when needed, ensuring business continuity and data protection.

Database Upgrades and Migrations: When upgrading or migrating databases within containers, Docker volumes can be used to preserve the database files. By mounting the same volume to a new container with an upgraded version of the database, you can seamlessly transition the data and continue operations without loss or downtime.

Shared Configurations: Docker volumes can be used to share configuration files between the host system and containers. This allows for easy configuration management, as changes made to the configuration files in the volume are immediately available to the containers.

Without Docker volumes, the world of containerized applications would face several limitations and challenges:

Data Loss and Inconsistency: Containers would lose all data and changes made within them once they are stopped or removed, leading to data loss and inconsistency between different runs of the same container.

Limited Collaboration: Containers would struggle to share and exchange data, hindering collaboration between different components or services within an application.

Lack of Persistence: Applications requiring persistent storage, such as databases or file systems, would face difficulties in preserving and accessing data across container restarts or updates.

Complex Backup and Recovery: Backing up and recovering data within containers would become more complex and error-prone, potentially leading to data loss and longer recovery times.

In summary, Docker volumes are essential for achieving data persistence, sharing, and reliable storage in containerized applications. They play a vital role in maintaining application data integrity, enabling collaboration, and facilitating backup and disaster recovery strategies. Without Docker volumes, containers would be limited in their ability to handle persistent data, leading to data loss, inconsistent application behavior, and operational challenges.



# COMMANDS

## Open a terminal and create a volume

    docker volume create myvol

## List the volumes

    docker volume ls
docker creat
## Run a Nginx container that will use the volume

    docker run -d --name voltest -v myvol:/app nginx:latest

## Connect to the instance

    docker exec -it voltest bash

## Letâ€™s create a file in the volume using Nano

    apt-get update
    apt-get install nano

## Create a file in the app folder
    cd app
    nano test.txt

Type something, save the file and exit Nano using:

    CTRL-O
    CTRL-X

Detach from the instance:

    exit

## Stop and remove the container

    docker stop voltest
    docker rm voltest

## Run it again and see if the file still exists

    docker run -d --name voltest -v myvol:/app nginx:latest
    docker exec -it voltest bash
    cd app
    cat test.txt

## Cleanup

    docker volume rm myvol
    docker stop voltest
    docker rm voltest
